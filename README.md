** IdeaBox

This is our IdeaBox group project. A user can save, view, favorite, search, comment on, and delete their ideas and comments. We incorporated localStorage so idea cards are not lost on a page refresh, and snappy filtering so a user doesn't have to type a whole word to see their cards filtered.

There are no prerequisite programs or tools needed. This app runs in a browser and does not require downloads. User inputs are only stored on their local browser.

* How to use it:
BULLET POINTS
When you have an idea, type your title and body text into the fields and click save. Your idea will display on a card.

If you want to favorite an idea, click the star icon on the idea card. To remove that card from your favorites, click the star icon again. To view favorited cards, click Show Starred Ideas.
// screenshot of main page with the same cards, but some are starred

If you want to delete an idea, click on the X icon on the idea card.
// screenshot of main page, but some cards are gone, and can you get it so that the mouse is over the X and it's orange when you take the screenshot? that would be cool.

If you want to comment on an idea, click on the + icon or the Comment at the bottom of the card. Enter comment text into the field and click Add Comment. Cards can each have multiple comments.

If you want to view comments on an idea, click on the message icon on the bottom of the card. To delete a comment, click the X icon next to the comment.

If you want to search ideas, enter text into the Search Ideas field. Ideas will display if their Title or Body text includes the search query.

This project was built by Chris Spohn, Kelsie Besinger Yeh, and Elsa Fluss, with input from our instructors and mentors. We appreciate CodePen, W3Schools, MDN, and StackOverflow for never getting annoyed with us.
