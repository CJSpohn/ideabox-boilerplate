# IdeaBox

## Overview

The IdeaBox is a group project for the Turing School of Software and Design. The purpose of the application is to allow users to create and keep track of ideas and their respective comments.

In Ideabox, a user can save, view, favorite, search, comment on, and delete their ideas and comments. We incorporated local storage, so idea cards are not lost on a page refresh, and snappy filtering so a user doesn't have to type a whole word to see their cards filtered.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/ideabox-group.html).

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisite programs or tools needed. This app runs in a browser and does not require downloads. User inputs are only stored within their browser so ideas persist on page refresh.

### Using the App

* When you have an idea, type your title and body text into the fields and click save. Your idea will display on a card.

If you want to favorite an idea, click the star icon on the idea card. To remove that card from your favorites, click the star icon again. To view favorited cards, click Show Starred Ideas.

If you want to comment on an idea, click on the + icon or the Comment at the bottom of the card. Enter comment text into the field and click Add Comment. Cards can each have multiple comments.
